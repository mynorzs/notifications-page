## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript


### What I learned

In this lesson I practice how to loop through DOM elements and make buttons interactive inside that loop, instead of creating a bunch of JS variables for each of the seven notification items. I tried to do it this way, because I want to be able to make more interactive websites that will eventually call information from another source.

### Continued development

Next I want to make a more complete website or game that pushes me to research more advanced JS or even using an API.
